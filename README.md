SimulationVirusSpreadWithSpringAndReact

This project is still in development, but already working. It 
is a fullstack application simulating a virus spread among an 
animal population. 

In the backend I used the Spring Framework, especially Spring 
Boot, Spring Data JPA with Hibernate and H2 Database, Spring 
Web and Spring Security. For the frontend I used React. 

The communication between frontend and backend is based on 
REST API, except for the exchange of simulation data, which
is realized by using a WebSocket connection. 

All pictures that I used in the frontend are from pexels.com
and the original map image was generated by DALL.E.
